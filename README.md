## üìå Approach & Explanation

1Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching Pok√©mon Data
    The app fetches paginated Pok√©mon data from Pok√©API.
  Pok√©mon details (name, type, stats, abilities) are fetched on demand when clicking a Pok√©mon.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Search, Sort & Filter
  Search: Filters Pok√©mon by name instantly.
  Sorting: Users can sort Pok√©mon alphabetically or by base experience.
  Filtering: Pok√©mon can be filtered by type (Fire, Water, etc.).
3Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive UI
  Mobile-friendly grid layout ensures Pok√©mon display nicely on all devices.
  Smooth animations and hover effects improve UX.
  Gradient buttons & loading spinners provide a modern feel.

  ‚öñÔ∏è Challenges & Trade-offs
1Ô∏è‚É£ API Rate Limits
Challenge: Pok√©API has rate limits, so fetching detailed Pok√©mon data for sorting can be slow.
Solution: We fetch only paginated Pok√©mon first, then make parallel API calls to fetch details.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization
Challenge: Fetching Pok√©mon details separately increases network requests.
Solution: Used Promise.all() to fetch details asynchronously & efficiently.
3Ô∏è‚É£ UI & Responsiveness
Challenge: Designing a UI that looks good on both desktop & mobile.
Solution: Used Tailwind CSS for easy grid layouts, responsive padding, and adaptive buttons.
