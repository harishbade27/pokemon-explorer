## üîç Approach & Explanation

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Fetching Pok√©mon Data

* The app fetches paginated Pok√©mon data from Pok√©API.
* Pok√©mon details (name, type, stats, abilities) are fetched on demand when clicking a Pok√©mon.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Search, Sort & Filter
* Search: Filters Pok√©mon by name instantly.
* Sorting: Users can sort Pok√©mon alphabetically or by base experience.
* Filtering: Pok√©mon can be filtered by type (Fire, Water, etc.).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Responsive UI
* Mobile-friendly grid layout ensures Pok√©mon display nicely on all devices.
* Smooth animations and hover effects improve UX.
* Gradient buttons & loading spinners provide a modern feel.


## ‚öñÔ∏è Challenges & Trade-offs

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ API Rate Limits
* Challenge: Pok√©API has rate limits, so fetching detailed Pok√©mon data for sorting can be slow.
* Solution: We fetch only paginated Pok√©mon first, then make parallel API calls to fetch details.

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Performance Optimization
* Challenge: Fetching Pok√©mon details separately increases network requests.
* Solution: Used Promise.all() to fetch details asynchronously & efficiently.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ UI & Responsiveness
* Challenge: Designing a UI that looks good on both desktop & mobile.
* Solution: Used Tailwind CSS for easy grid layouts, responsive padding, and adaptive buttons.
